#+Title: MVNpermute

* Description
  If you have a vector of data that follows a multivariate normal
  distribution with a mean determined by a matrix of covariates and a
  known covariance matrix, this package allows you to generate
  permutation based resamples of your data. This is useful if you wish
  to do a permutation based test, as opposed to doing a parametric
  bootstrap, for instance. The distribution of the generated samples
  will be identical to the original multivariate normal distribution
  but will not, in general, be a literal permutation of the original
  values. This is because the process of estimating the mean from
  the covariate data reduces the dimensionality of the space in which
  to perform the permutation. For more detail see Abney M (2015)

  Epidemiology, 39, 249-258, and Abney M et al (2000) Estimation of
  Variance Components of Quantitative Traits in an Inbred Population,
  American Journal of Human Genetics, 66, 629-650.
